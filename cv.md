About me

I am a junior frontend software developer. My experience is confined to pet projects.
I like doing frontend because that way I can see the result of my work right away.
I have been working as a professional musician for 10 years, and as an
English teacher for 3 years. Unfortunately, there's not a lot of room to manoeuvre 
if you are a musician, you can't do this everywhere and it's hard to be yourself
without sacrificing things that are important to you. As for English, I would say
that I like speaking it more than teaching. I am really exited about my jorney in
IT, and will do my best to be an awesome developer
